# billshop
A full-stack ecommerce App - with techstack of Next-js, Redux toolkit, Mongodb
=======
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).


## Technical Stack

BillShop is built on a modern, robust full-stack architecture designed for scalability and efficient data handling. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of our technical stack:


**Frontend Framework: Next.js -** A React framework that enables functionality such as server-side rendering and generating static websites.


**State Management: Redux Toolkit -** Provides a scalable approach to managing state in the application with tools to simplify common Redux patterns.


**Backend Database: MongoDB -** A NoSQL database that uses a document-oriented data model and a flexible schema for storing data.


**Authentication & Storage: Firebase -** Utilized for secure authentication processes and efficient management of image uploads.


****Payment Processing:** Stripe -** Integrated for handling secure, reliable payment transactions including charges and refunds.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

 ## **User Experience**
 
**Role-Based Access:**

Implements distinct access levels for 'User' and 'Admin', ensuring secure and context-aware interactions across the platform.


**Multi-Image Upload:**

Integrate with Firebase for handling multiple image uploads, making product listings both comprehensive and appealing.


**Dynamic Filters & Search:**

Utilize Server Components for creating responsive and quick-filtering capabilities, enhancing product discovery.


**Inventory Management:**

Robust stock management tools to track and manage product availability effectively.


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
